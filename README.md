# Arsenal Shooting Data
A short analysis on Arsenal shooting data from the 23-24 and 24-25 seasons. Data used for this project has been obtained from the following sources, I have used Power BI to create the visualisations used in this project.

## The project

As an aspiring data analyst that has only recently discovered a pathway into the industry I wanted to start out my first project on a topic that I hold close, and a small project looking at some data from my favourite football team seemed the most obvious choice. 
It's a project that I could very easily get invested into and would allow me to dip my toes into the world of data without feeling out of my depth.

For my first project I opted for a simple and small project to build on the foundations developed throughout my data technician skills bootcamp, which resulted in me taking a look at some of the goalscoring and shooting data from Arsenal players over the course of the 23-24 and 24-25 Premier League seasons. 
I chose this area as Arsenal had suffered a dropoff in goalscoring between the two seasons, scoring significantly less goals in the 24/25 season compared to the previous. 
The scope of my focus was to look at the efficiency of the squads shooting, which would allow insights into the squad's ability to score given the chances that were being created. 
Given that the scope of this project is fairly small, I am looking purely at the squad's ability to convert shots into goals and have not looked at other factors such as: quality of chance creation; location shots were taken from; quality of opposition; and other such related factors. 

The data used for this project has been linked at the top of this file, and only include data from players that have played a minimum of 450 minutes (5 games total) in either season.

## Pure goalscoring data

The first area of focus for this project was the raw goalscoring numbers of each player within the squad. Goals scored is an obvious starting point to look at when identifying potential focal point for shooting efficiency as it allows us to see who the biggest contributers are from the 23-24 season, and easily identify any dropoff from their goalscoring in the following season. 
This can then be looked at in further detail when looking at their efficiency and help us to see if an underlying factor in that dropoff is related to their ability to convert shots to goals. The following column chart details the goalscoring data from the 23-24 season.

Immediately apparent is that a significant portion of the goalscoring this season can be attributed to three players: Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard. These three players combine for 41 goals while the remaining **thirteen** players combine for 44 goals, meaning Saka, Havertz and Trossard were responsible for 48% of Arsenal's Premier League goals that season.
The midfield were able to chip in with 15 goals (roughly 17% of goals) split between Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice which is a fairly healthy amount in support of the main attacking force, with the rotation attackers of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah also combining for 15 goals. 
The defence were also able to contribute 14 goals, again providing a healthy contribution. From the basic goalscoring numbers this season was fairly successful for the team, however the same cannot be said for the following season.
